# Lexiconaut Library Name Generator

Tired of naming your web framework after your pet iguana? Can't decide which obscure jazz musician to honor next? Fear not! Our Library Name Generator is here to rescue you from the depths of naming despair.

Whether you're aiming for:
- The Django-esque coolness of naming your creation after a guitarist with killer fingerpicking skills
- The React-like simplicity of just describing what your library does (but not really)

We've got you covered! Who knows, maybe your next big project will be named after:
- A 1920s tap dancer
- A vintage typewriter brand
- Or something equally quirky and nonsensical!

The possibilities are endless, and equally entertaining.

This AI-powered application generates creative library names based on your specified:
- Programming language
- Topic
- Purpose

## It named itself!

Lexiconaut: A fusion of 'lexicon' (vocabulary) and 'naut' (explorer), implying a journey through a world of potential names. It captures the adventurous and exploratory nature of finding the perfect name.
